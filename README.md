Tic Tac Toe: MCTS vs Minimax
This repository contains an implementation of an nxn Tic Tac Toe game where two algorithms, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Minimax, compete against each other. MCTS is a probabilistic search algorithm that is efficient in open-ended environments with an enormous amount of possibilities. Minimax, on the other hand, is a decision-making algorithm that computes many levels in the game tree to find the optimal move. Both algorithms have their strengths and weaknesses and provide a challenging competition in an nxn Tic Tac Toe game.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README to set up the environment and run the game.
